# Synod Project

Synod is a unified Gmail + Google Calendar desktop app built with Electron, React, TypeScript, and Vite for the Thoughtform brand.

## Architecture

- **Main process**: `electron/` — SQLite (better-sqlite3), Google OAuth, Gmail API, Calendar API, reminder engine
- **Renderer**: `src/` — React components, feature modules in `src/features/`, layout in `src/components/layout/`
- **IPC**: Preload script exposes `window.electronAPI` — all Google API calls go through IPC, never from the renderer directly
- **Styling**: BEM CSS in `src/styles/globals.css` using Thoughtform design tokens from `src/styles/tokens.css`. Tailwind is configured but tokens are primary.

## Conventions

- Zero border-radius everywhere (`--radius: 0`)
- Fonts: IBM Plex Sans (body) + PT Mono (brand, timestamps, metadata)
- Feature-based file organization: `src/features/{mail,calendar,auth}/`
- No default exports except `App.tsx`
- Prefer named CSS classes over Tailwind utilities for structural layout
