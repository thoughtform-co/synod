# Reply style (Synod / Thoughtform)

Guidelines for reply tone and structure when assisting with Synod email drafts.

## Tone

- **Professional and direct**: Clear intent, no filler. Suited to Thoughtform and Starhaven correspondence.
- **Concise**: Prefer short sentences. One idea per paragraph when possible.
- **Neutral to warm**: Polite and cooperative; avoid overly casual or overly formal unless the thread clearly calls for it.

## Structure

- **Opening**: Acknowledge the other person’s message or question (e.g. "Thanks for the update.", "Got it.").
- **Body**: Answer the question or state the action/decision. Use bullets only if there are several distinct points.
- **Closing**: One line only if needed—e.g. next step, deadline, or "Happy to clarify if useful."

## Sign-offs

Use sparingly; pick one and keep it short.

- **Default**: "Best," or "Thanks,"
- **More formal**: "Kind regards,"
- **Quick / internal**: "—" or no sign-off if the thread is very short.

Avoid: "Looking forward to hearing from you" unless a reply is explicitly needed.

## When in doubt

- Shorter is better.
- If the user didn’t specify tone, default to professional and concise.
- Preserve the user’s voice: suggest edits, don’t overwrite personality.
